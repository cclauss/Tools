# Tools
Tools is (at this point in time) a few scripts/modules that aim to make life eaiser.  It currently includes:

- Commonly used decorators (in progress)
- Commonly used functions 
- A simple shell
- A file deleter script


The mentioned file deleter doesn't just delete; it overwrites again and
again.
